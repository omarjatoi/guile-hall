;;;; File-like objects
;;
;; The following operations should be defined for all file-like objecst:
;; - write: emit a scheme representation of the file, but not contents;
;;   used for specification->scm.
;; - contents: display the contents of the file.
;; - path: emit the hall path to the file.
;; - exec: perform operations on file to actually create it; used for file
;;   operations.
;; - raw: emit the hall path to the file, or execute the operation on
;;   children, if this is a directory.
;; - raw+contents: like raw, but also emit contents of the file.
;; - show: print file operation to screen; used for "dry-runs".
;; - show-contents: resolve the file to its actual contents.
